# Search

## Context

This command provides intelligent web search capabilities that integrate with project context, build search patterns over time, and generate contextual summaries relevant to development needs through systematic search methodology. It conducts contextual searches with full awareness of project context, current challenges, and accumulated knowledge.

## Your Task

Execute the following steps to conduct systematic web search:

1. **Initialize sequential thinking**: Use `mcp__thinking__sequentialthinking` to plan the search approach
2. **Read memory context**: Use `mcp__memory__read_graph` to understand existing search knowledge and project context
3. **Context analysis**: Use `mcp__memory__read_graph` and `mcp__memory__search_nodes` to understand current project state and requirements
4. **Search execution**: Use `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` to conduct systematic searches
5. **Content analysis**: Analyze and synthesize search findings for project relevance
6. **Memory integration**: Update search intelligence using `mcp__memory__*` tools
7. **Generate recommendations**: Provide actionable insights and implementation guidance

## Verification

- Confirm search strategy was developed based on project context and requirements
- Verify search execution was systematic and covered multiple reliable sources
- Check that findings were analyzed for project-specific relevance
- Ensure recommendations are actionable with clear implementation guidance
- Validate that search intelligence was updated in memory

## Output

The command should produce:

- Comprehensive search results with project-specific relevance and analysis
- Actionable recommendations with implementation guidance and examples
- Updated search intelligence in project memory for future reference
- Documented search patterns and source reliability for knowledge accumulation
- Strategic insights that connect findings with project requirements and architecture
