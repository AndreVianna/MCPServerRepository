# Design Handoff Template

## Overview
This template provides a structured approach for design handoff using MCP tools integration.

## Pre-Handoff Checklist

### Designer Responsibilities
- [ ] Design file organized with clear naming conventions
- [ ] Components properly documented in Figma
- [ ] Design tokens defined and consistent
- [ ] Accessibility considerations documented
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints specified
- [ ] Interactive states defined
- [ ] Asset export specifications provided

### Development Team Preparation
- [ ] Review design specifications
- [ ] Understand component requirements
- [ ] Validate technical feasibility
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Configure MCP tools integration

## Handoff Process

### Step 1: Design Review
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Participants**: Designer, Lead Developer, QA Lead

**Agenda**:
1. Design overview and objectives
2. Component specifications review
3. Technical considerations discussion
4. Accessibility requirements
5. Performance considerations
6. Timeline and milestone planning

### Step 2: Asset Extraction
**Responsible**: Lead Developer
**Tools**: Figma MCP

```bash
# Extract assets from Figma
./scripts/mcp-tools-integration.sh extract-figma FIGMA_FILE_KEY assets/figma/

# Update design tokens
./scripts/mcp-tools-integration.sh design-tokens FIGMA_FILE_KEY
```

**Deliverables**:
- Extracted assets (SVG, PNG)
- Updated design tokens (CSS variables)
- Component specifications document

### Step 3: Implementation Planning
**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Participants**: Development Team

**Tasks**:
1. Break down components into development tasks
2. Define component interfaces and APIs
3. Plan testing strategy
4. Estimate development effort
5. Create implementation timeline

### Step 4: Development Implementation
**Responsible**: Development Team
**Tools**: Playwright MCP for testing

```bash
# Generate visual regression tests
./scripts/mcp-tools-integration.sh visual-tests COMPONENT_NAME

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/mcp-tools-integration.sh run-tests all development
```

**Deliverables**:
- Implemented components
- Component documentation
- Automated tests
- Visual regression tests

### Step 5: Quality Assurance
**Responsible**: QA Team
**Tools**: Playwright MCP

**Testing Areas**:
- Functional testing
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Step 6: Design Validation
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Participants**: Designer, Lead Developer

**Validation Points**:
1. Visual accuracy comparison
2. Interaction behavior verification
3. Accessibility compliance check
4. Performance metrics review
5. Responsive design validation

## Communication Protocols

### Status Updates
- **Daily**: Progress updates in team chat
- **Weekly**: Status summary to stakeholders
- **Milestone**: Formal review and approval

### Issue Resolution
1. **Design Questions**: Direct designer consultation
2. **Technical Issues**: Team lead escalation
3. **Quality Issues**: QA lead coordination
4. **Timeline Issues**: Project manager notification

## Documentation Requirements

### Design Documentation
- Component specifications
- Interaction guidelines
- Accessibility requirements
- Performance criteria

### Technical Documentation
- Component API documentation
- Test coverage reports
- Performance metrics
- Deployment instructions

## Success Criteria

### Design Fidelity
- [ ] Visual appearance matches design specifications
- [ ] Interactions behave as designed
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints implemented correctly
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

### Technical Quality
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Tests provide adequate coverage
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security considerations addressed

### Process Efficiency
- [ ] Handoff completed within timeline
- [ ] Minimal design-development iterations
- [ ] Clear communication throughout process
- [ ] Documentation updated and complete

## Post-Handoff Activities

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Monitor component performance
- Address user feedback
- Update documentation
- Plan future enhancements

### Knowledge Sharing
- Document lessons learned
- Share best practices
- Update templates and processes
- Train team members

## Template Customization

This template can be customized for specific project needs:

1. **Project-Specific Requirements**: Add project-specific checklist items
2. **Team Structure**: Adjust roles and responsibilities
3. **Tools Integration**: Modify commands and scripts
4. **Timeline Adjustments**: Adapt durations based on project complexity
5. **Communication Preferences**: Customize notification channels
