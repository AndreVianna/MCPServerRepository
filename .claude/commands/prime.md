# Prime

This command loads essential context for working with the current project.

## Required Steps
 - Run the `lt` bash command to get the latest structure of the project
 - Apply all instructions defined in the CLAUDE.md file
 - Read the full content of the memory.
 - The progress of the project should always be saved in the memory so it can be resumed when the context is conpacted, when we reach a usage limit, or when we restart the CLI.
 - Always think sequentially and use a step-by-step approach.

## Instructions
 - You must run all the items in the 'Required Steps' section to prepare the context for this session.
 - When updating the project memory you must analyse the whole memory (memory graph) to identify the best way to update it. Avoid duplications, redundancies amd identify stale items to remove. Update the relations carefuly to represent the interconnection of the entities correctly. Think sequentially to update the memory and do that step-by-step.
